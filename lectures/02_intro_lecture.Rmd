# Introduction (Week 1)

Goals for today

- Pique your interest
- Get to know each other

## Land-Use change


- What kind of land-use change can you see in the video below? 

- What human impacts are not captured by this video or by satellite observation in general? 

- Which land-use changes are most likely to impact inland waters?

If you enjoy looking at these timelapses, I encourage you to play around with this [website from Google and Carnegie Melon](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) which shows the entire globe changing over the past 30 years.

## Types of Water Quality Change


- What water quality problem do you think is most pressing right now in Colorado? in the United States? the Globe? 

- What causes the water quality problem you identifed from above? Was it land-use change or something else? 

## Examples of water quality impacts 

For each image answer the following questions

- what is the water quality impact you see? 
- What may have caused this impact? 
- Is it natural or human-caused? 


## Lake Erie

and on and on and on.

## Summary

- What do these water quality impacts have in common?
- Which impacts do you think will be fixed in the next year, decade, century? 
- The goal of this course is for you to intuitively and quantitatively understand the linkages between human's actions on land and our downstream water quality impacts.
